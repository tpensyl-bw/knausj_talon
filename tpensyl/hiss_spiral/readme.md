This mouse has a couple of features 


1. you only need to be able to hiss to turn it on operate it.  No need for spoken words, or vocal cords, or anything but the ability to start making a hissing noise and stop making a hissing noise.  

(it does require being able to make the popping noise to make the crosshairs disappear)


This mouse works the same way a fed-ex delivery truck works:  It moves every time you start hissing, then makes a 90 degree clockwise turn every time you stop.  It follows a pattern: north, east, south, west.  So you can aim the mouse in a direction, and if you overshoot, you can go 'around the block' to get to where you are going.  

This mouse will allow you to get anywhere on the screen with a series of hisses.
